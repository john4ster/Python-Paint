# Python Paint
Please note that this project is still being worked on, and is not finished yet.

Python Paint is a simple drawing application that allows the user to draw on a grid using different drawing tools, brush sizes, and colors.

Currently, you can draw with the brush tool and erase with the eraser tool. You can also select a brush size and a color. The eye dropper tool and fill tool don't currently work, but they will be implemented soon.
